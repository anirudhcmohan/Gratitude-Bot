Author: Ani Mohan

## What is it?
A Messenger bot that tries to cultivate more gratitude in the world. 

## How does it work? 
Message the bot with brief snippets of what you were grateful for in the past day. 

Don't worry if you forget -- the bot will remind you once a day to reflect at the end of the day.

## What's the point?
Studies [show](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/how-expressing-gratitude-change-your-brain.html) that cultivating a mindset of gratitude can bring about a range of benefits. Think of this bot as a lightweight way of getting started with changing the way you think.

## That's it?
Yep! The best part is, once you start reflecting on what you're grateful for, the bot will message you daily with something you recently entered. This'll allow you to visit past moments of gratitude without having to proactively look for it.
